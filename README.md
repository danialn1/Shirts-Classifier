# Shirts-Classifier


Here I developed a machine learning model that can classify between
images of T-shirts and dress-shirts using hog features. 


TrainData.csv: It contains 12000 training examples. Each row contains 784 values.
The dataset has been derived from Fashion-MNIST dataset. Each example is a flattened
28x28 pixel gray-scale image. You can reshape the examples to visualize what each
image looks like.


TrainLabels.csv: This file contains true labels for the examples in TrainExamples.csv
(T-shirts = 1 , dress-shirts = -1)


TestData.csv: This file contains test examples.
